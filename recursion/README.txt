#Usage:
	-In the realm of computer science and programming, efficient code design and optimization 
	are fundamental skills that empower developers to create applications that perform seamlessly 
	and responsively. The task of generating the Fibonacci sequence is not only a classic mathematical 
	challenge but also a valuable opportunity to explore the intricacies of assembly programming. 
	This assignment endeavors to design a MIPS 32 Assembly program that calculates and prints the 
	Fibonacci sequence based on the user's input. Beyond the immediate goal of generating the sequence, 
	this assignment also prompts an evaluation of programming strategies. Specifically, it encourages 
	consideration of using saved registers versus temporary registers, enabling students to delve into 
	the nuances of optimization and resource management. The study of the Fibonacci sequence is not only 
	a journey through numbers but also a journey into the heart of assembly programming, where every 
	choice in code design has a tangible impact on efficiency. Through the exploration of recursive 
	functions, choice of registers, and performance improvements, this assignment equips students with 
	a deeper understanding of programming and its real-world implications.
