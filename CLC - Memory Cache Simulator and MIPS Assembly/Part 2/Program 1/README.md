#Usage:
	-The purpose of this code is to take to numbers that are inputed by the user and add those numbers together. This program aims to show that the students know how to write MIPS code that prompts the user to input items, stores those items in specific registers, and perform basic addition. The objective of this code is simple and students should come away with a better understanding of how write MIPS code can be used to dirrectly work with the computers hardware using a compiler like QtSpim.
